   "content": "Chapter 1\n\n Mima is a young 19 year old girl who has just started her university, she was a bit shy, still waiting for the life to hit her, but somehow full of life. She was born in a small town of west end American mountains. She had spent most of her childhood in big cities and still being somewhat unseen by the crowds and a little but of her university life in a samller town but yet very well touched and understood by the people. She had a very loving mother, somehow a tolerable brother and a very strict father. \n\n\n\nIt was middle of the year of 2024 when her family planned a cruise trip. It was a all round trip stopping at various places in the south of europe, she was looking forward to it. \n\nAs the time of the trip came closer she got more and more excited, “eh, finally something of a new varient in this life”, she said to herself. \n\nAlthough her life was not a boring life, she had friends, she did yoga, had an active social life since she moved to the new town but still something felt missing. \n\n\n\nThe soon the time passed and the time of the cruise came. They reached a small town named Kalamata in south of Greece. The cruise was supposed to be fourteen day cruise starting from Greece and ending all the way to Los Muertos in Spain. Her family reached Kalamata one day prior to the day of boarding the cruise, she was excited, she wasn’t the kind of girl who would post an update on social media as soon as she did something new in her life, in fact she was deeply introverted person who rarely allowed anyone to know her , her close group of friends and her mother knew most about her, even her own father was mostly unknown with the kind of storms her quite unnoticed heart goes from time to time.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\n\nThe day they boarded the cruise, the sea was calm and the sun seemed gentler than usual, as if it too was preparing for something. Mima stood at the deck in her linen trousers and oversized sunglasses, her headphones resting lightly around her neck. Her family was inside, fussing over lunch options, but she remained outside, quietly taking in the vastness of the sea.\n\nThere was something about the horizon that made her heart ache—not with sadness, but with a longing she couldn’t place. It wasn’t new. She had always felt things a bit deeper than others, a little more layered. She watched the waves, their endless rolling, and felt a strange pull in her chest—as if something out there recognized her.\n\nThat evening, they docked briefly at a small, lesser-known coastal village in eastern Albenia. Tourists weren’t many, and the locals, weathered but warm, carried baskets of fruit and wine through narrow cobbled streets. Mima wandered off, as she often did, promising to be back before dinner. Her mother smiled softly at her, used to her daughter’s dreamy detours.\n\nShe found herself following a narrow path that led to the edge of the cliff. Below, hidden from most of the town’s view, lay a quiet cove with emerald waters. And anchored just a little way from the shore was a ship, not like the usual cruise liners, not even like a yacht.\n\nIt was beautiful, though old. Sleek and dark with gold accents. The sails were drawn but shimmered oddly against the twilight. The ship looked like it had no place in this century.\n\nAnd then she saw him. \n\nOn the deck stood a man in a long coat. He wasn’t waving, wasn’t calling. He was simply watching her as if he had known she would come. As if he’d been waiting.\n\nA strange warmth filled her chest, and the world seemed to hush for a moment. No birds. No breeze. Just the soft hiss of the tide below.\n\nAfter a while, Mima went to buy some oranges from the local market. She liked eating fruits—especially on warm days like this. As she sorted through a crate, one of the oranges slipped from her hand and rolled away.\n\nShe bent to pick it up, but another hand reached it first.\n\nIt was him.\n\nThe same man she had seen on the ship.\n\nHe said nothing. Just handed her the orange.\n\nMima froze for a second, caught off-guard. She hesitated but took it. And in doing so, she made the mistake of meeting his eyes.\n\nThere was nothing threatening in them—no smirk, no mischief. But there was a depth, an impossible stillness, like he had seen centuries pass and forgotten which ones mattered.\n\nBefore she could think, before she could speak or even thank him, he was gone. As if swallowed by the market itself.\n\nShe looked around, scanning faces and stalls, but the man had vanished into the noise and the color.\n\nYet the feeling remained.\n\nA quiet shift. Like something within her had been unlocked. Something that she hadn’t come in terms with yet.\n\nShe walked back to the cruise dock with the orange still in her hand.\n\nThat night, Mima couldn’t sleep. A low hum filled her dreams, and in them, she saw the same ship again—rocking gently on an endless sea of stars. The man stood at the helm, his coat fluttering soundlessly. \n\nHis voice—refined, patient—echoed like it came from the sea itself: \n\n“We come not for the willing, Mima. We come for the waiting.”\n\nThe next morning was a fast one, the cruise ship was destined to go to one of the very happening cities of the Italian coast.\n\nThe sun came bright and warm. The cabin curtains fluttered gently in the breeze, sunlight spilling across the wooden floor in golden lines. Mima woke with a soft smile, the remnants of her strange dream dissolving like sugar in tea.  She started preparing for all the things she was going to check off from her itinerary. She was excited again and looking forward to her day.\n\nToday, the cruise had docked at one of Italy’s most beautiful coastal towns. The sea sparkled like crushed glass. Tourists filled the streets, music played from open cafés, and the air smelled of citrus and sea salt.\n\nMima tied her hair up, slipped into a summer dress, and joined her family for breakfast on the upper deck. Her mother raved about the ceramics market, her brother teased her about her journal obsession, and even her father seemed unusually relaxed, sipping his espresso without a single complaint.\n\nEverything felt right. \n\nFull of promise. \n\n New. Alive.\n\nThe air had a very shallow but very tangible sense of happiness in it.\n\nShe wandered the city with a small notebook in hand, sketching balconies and shopfronts. Bought postcards she’d never send. Tasted fig gelato from a cheerful old woman who insisted on giving her two scoops. The bells from a distant church rang out as she followed narrow cobbled streets, humming to herself. With all this , she decided to visit the beech.  The seashore wasn’t sandy, it was well paved, seemed as if a medium sized boat could easily dock there, she decided to take some pictures just for the sake of memory. Everything was going well, she had a smile on her face that she just couldn’t wipe off even if she tried.\n\nAnd then—\n\nEverything stopped.\n\nThe air snapped.\n\nThe warmth vanished in an instant, replaced by a deep, biting cold.\n\nThe world around her paused—the sounds of the city went mute, like someone had stuffed cotton into her ears. The crowd she had been walking through was suddenly gone.\n\nNo people. No wind. No sun. Just grey.\n\nA low sound began to rise behind her. Not music. Not voices.\n\nA hum.\n\nThe same one from her dreams—but louder now. Mechanical. Wet. Ancient.\n\nShe turned around—\n\nAnd the ship was there.\n\nMassive. Silent. Waiting.\n\nThe mist poured from beneath it, curling around her ankles, pulling at her feet like fingers. And at the top of the gangway stood some men. There was an air of harrowing and petrifying aura coming out of those men. As they came closer and closer, it was clear that their was no humanity left in them. Not fully.\n\n“Pirates!”, someone screamed from the background. The entire town’s mood behind her had shifted and she stood on the edge on the end, seeming as if on one side of her were these inhuman looking pirates and on the other end was that city where she was strolling just few minutes back. \n\nMima tried to run, she tried to scream.\n\nNothing came out.\n\nHer legs wouldn’t move—frozen.\n\nThe street, the bells, the sun—they were gone, like someone had torn a curtain from the stage.\n\nAll that remained was the ship.\n\nAnd the gruesome men who were operating it.\n\nShe somehow gathered the courage and started running away, tearing through the mist-choked air. Her sandals slapped against the cobblestones, lungs burning, heart screaming louder than her voice could. She didn’t care where she was going—just away. Away from the ship. From him.\n\nThen she heard it.\n\nThe thud. A heavy, hollow sound—like anchors dropping not on water, but on stone.\n\nShe turned a corner—and stopped dead.\n\nThe street she'd just passed through, vibrant just moments ago, was now drenched in a sickly gray haze. People were coughing. Stumbling. Some were already on the ground, limbs twitching, hands grasping at their throats.\n\nThen she saw them.\n\nPipes—thick, metallic hoses—snaking from the side of the ship and coiling through the mist, pumping out some kind of gas. Not thick enough to blind, but heavy enough to cling to the skin, to coat the lungs.\n\nIt smelled metallic. Acidic. Wrong.\n\nThe people caught in it first began to stagger. Then freeze. Not in some cinematic, magical way—but in the real, terrifying way a body shuts down under chemicals. Muscles locking. Joints refusing to obey. Screams cut short as mouths gaped but no air came in.\n\nA woman dropped to her knees beside a stroller, clawing at the air. A man in a hotel uniform keeled over, convulsing violently. Mima stared, numb, as a teenager tried to crawl across the pavement—only to be grabbed by two of the masked figures and hauled upright like cargo.\n\nThe pirates moved quickly. Gas masks. Gloves. Tactical precision. No yelling. No panic. Just action. This was a practiced operation.\n\nMima turned and ran again—but her legs were already weakening. Her throat was raw, her head swimming. The gas was spreading fast, and the city had become a maze. She could hear others screaming now—farther off—cut off mid-cry, like someone flicking a switch.\n\nShe reached the edge of the old harbor. People were still there—fewer now. Staring. Some filming on their phones, unaware of how close they were to collapse.\n\nAnd then came the sound.\n\nA bell.\n\nNot from a church, but from the ship. Deep, guttural, mechanical—like a warning before a blast.\n\nAnd then they dropped canisters.\n\nMima watched them roll across the stone like forgotten soda cans—until they hissed. High-pitched. Violent.\n\nThe second wave of gas came sharper. Hotter. It hit the nerves directly. Mima fell to her knees, her hands shaking uncontrollably.\n\nAround her, people collapsed—one by one.\n\nSome tried to crawl. Others just twitched.\n\nHer vision blurred. She couldn’t move. Couldn’t scream. Her lungs were shutting down in slow motion.\n\nAnd then she saw them.\n\nComing from the fog.\n\nThe pirates. The same dark clothes. The same masks. Moving like a cleanup crew in a chemical zone. Checking pulses. Injecting something into necks. Tagging wrists with red tape. Hauling bodies, two at a time, into unmarked trucks backed up against the sea wall.\n\nMima’s last sight before she blacked out was a pair of black boots stopping inches from her face. \n\nThe hiss of a needle.\n\n The click of plastic handcuffs.\n\n And the shape of the ship, still waiting, still silent—its belly open for cargo.\n\nChapter 3\n\nA harsh fluorescent light buzzed overhead.\n\nMima blinked—slowly, painfully. Her body was cold. Her mouth was dry. She couldn’t move much, but her eyes fluttered open enough to see a pale ceiling and metal rails on either side of her.\n\nShe was strapped to a gurney.\n\nThe room was sterile. Clinical. It smelled of antiseptic and blood—too much blood. Dim shadows moved beyond the bright light above her, shapes of people in surgical gear: masks, gloves, plastic aprons splattered with things she didn’t want to name.\n\nShe tried to sit up. Nothing happened.\n\nHer wrists and ankles were bound. Something tugged at the back of her hand—an IV line, which seemed wasn’t there to keep her healthy but to make sure she stayed in half sedated state. A monitor beeped nearby, steady, detached, like it didn’t care what was about to happen.\n\nShe turned her head—just slightly.\n\nThat’s when she saw them.\n\nBodies.\n\nAt least five others, laid out on parallel gurneys. Some without life. Some with a little life left in them, moaning softly. One was already... open. A woman’s torso, split down the middle, her chest cavity hollowed out like something in a butcher’s freezer.\n\nMima’s stomach twisted. A girl who wasn’t even capable of hearing a scolding from her father had to witness this, this was too extreme for her.\n\nBehind a plastic divider, a man in a scrub cap and visor held a tray filled with organs—carefully arranged, labelled in ziplock bags. Liver. Kidneys. Eyes.\n\nThen she saw the table beside her gurney—already prepped with tools. Scalpel. Forceps. A bone saw.\n\nAnd the man next to it.\n\nHe wasn’t like the masked pirates. This one had a surgeon’s stillness. He checked her vitals with the casual efficiency of someone watering a plant. Then he reached for a small syringe from a metal tray—likely to knock her out again.\n\nMima’s throat felt like sandpaper, but she forced out a sound.\n\n“Why... why are you doing this...?”\n\nThe man paused.\n\nHe turned his head, slowly, looking at her through the foggy visor. For a moment, he just stared. Then he tilted his head—not with sympathy, but curiosity. Like she was a lab rat that had spoken.\n\n“Because,” he said, his voice calm, matter-of-fact, “every part of the human body is worth something.”\n\nHe leaned closer.\n\n“A kidney? Fifteen grand. Corneas, five. Livers, more if they’re clean. Bones, marrow, skin—all cataloged, all paid for. You’re not a person here. You’re inventory.”\n\nThen, without breaking eye contact, he added:\n\n“And ten bodies? That’s over five hundred thousand dollars in one night.”\n\nHe tapped the syringe to remove the air bubble.\n\n“Don’t worry,” he murmured, almost kindly. “You won’t feel a thing. That part’s not profitable.”\n\nMima’s heart thudded, hard and fast, as the needle inched closer.\n\nThe cold tip of the syringe hovered inches above her arm.\n\nMima’s breath caught in her throat. Tears were flowing through the sides of her eyes. \n\n She was mourining her own death, that itself is a strange feeling no 19 year old should ever experience. She had completely accepted what was supposed to happen now.\n\n She was now bracing herself for the pain that was about to come.\n\nAnd then—\n\n“Stop.”\n\nThe word cut through the room like a blade.\n\nEveryone froze.\n\nThe surgeon’s hand jerked back instinctively, his face suddenly pale beneath the visor. The assistant by the tray stepped away like he'd been burned.\n\n“She’s mine.”\n\nThe voice was calm, composed—but behind it was something absolute. Not pleading. Not bargaining.\n\nCommanding.\n\nBoots clicked against the floor.\n\nMima could barely turn her head, but she saw them all look toward the doorway. The masked surgeon lowered his head like a child caught doing something forbidden.\n\nThen the figure appeared in the sterile light.\n\nThe captain.\n\nStill in black. No surgical gear. No mask. Just a long coat wet from sea mist, and eyes that burned like something that had seen war, and worse.\n\nHe stepped into the operating room as if it were his own dining hall.\n\n“Unstrap her.”\n\nThe surgeon hesitated. “But—Captain, she was next—”\n\nThe captain’s gaze locked onto him. Just once.\n\nThe man said no more.\n\nHands moved quickly. The straps were undone, the IV pulled from her hand. Mima's arms dropped limply to her sides, too weak to move, too dizzy to speak. Her vision blurred—but the captain didn’t look at her like a savior. He looked at her like... property.\n\nHe signaled, and two crew members wheeled her gurney out of the surgical chamber. She saw more  bodies as she came outside the plastic dividers. Some still alive. Most not. She was finally wheeled out of the room.\n\nThe halls beyond were darker, quieter. The hum of machinery faded into the endless drone of waves outside.\n\nEventually, the gurney stopped.\n\nThe captain dismissed the crew with a single gesture. Then he turned to her, alone.\n\n“You weren’t supposed to be on that dock, Mima,” he said softly.\n\n“But now that you are...”\n\nHe crouched beside her, lowering his voice.  \n\n She realised who he was! He was the same man who handed her the orange, the same man whom she saw earlier! But something about him was off this time. He significantly seemed less human. As if there was only flesh and blood in him, no soul. At least that could be associated with human like kindness and empathy, not that it was shown in their earlier encounter but what small amount that was visible was now seemed lost. Absent.\n\nHis voice was deep and commanding.\n\n“This ship doesn’t sail near any map. It doesn’t need to. We collect, we deliver, we profit. But you...”\n\nHis fingers brushed the side of her face—gentle, almost reverent.\n\n“You’re not going anywhere. Not until I decide what you’re worth.”\n\nHe stood up and walked toward the door.\n\n“You should rest. You’re not scheduled for processing.”\n\nNot yet, she heard in the silence that followed.\n\nThe door clicked shut.\n\nAnd she was alone.\n\nStill alive.\n\nStill trapped.\n\nSomewhere far beyond the reach of help.\n\nSomewhere the sea didn’t speak her name.\n\n\n\nThe silence in the room was thick—too thick—until it wasn’t.\n\nMima stirred. Her wrists ached.\n\nShe looked down at her body.\n\nRed lines. Bruised skin.\n\nThe straps had left deep marks—angry imprints that told her she’d been held down for days, not hours. She tried to sit up, but her limbs quivered violently beneath her. Her knees buckled the moment she put weight on them, and she crumpled back onto the bed, gasping.\n\nThen came the sharper pain.\n\nHunger.\n\nNot just the discomfort of missing a meal, but the aching, deep kind—like her stomach was gnawing at itself. Her tongue was dry, her lips cracked. She hadn’t eaten. Not in days.\n\nShe tried to recall time, but it slipped like oil through her fingers. Was it three days? Four? She couldn’t tell.\n\nHer eyes blurred again. Her heart raced. Panic rose in her throat—\n\nAnd then the door opened.\n\nHe was back.\n\nThe captain.\n\nNo footsteps this time. Just presence.\n\nHe stepped into the room holding a metal tray. An IV bag swung gently from a portable stand he wheeled in behind him. On the tray: a tin cup of thick, pale-gray porridge, the kind you couldn’t name by flavor, and a syringe prepped to pierce.\n\n“You’ll feel worse before better,” he said, voice steady. “That’s the poison leaving.”\n\nShe recoiled slightly, but her body barely responded.\n\nHe didn’t ask. He took her arm and rolled up the sleeve. His grip wasn’t cruel—but it wasn’t gentle either. Familiar. Efficient.\n\n“This will sting.”\n\nThe IV needle pierced her skin in one clean motion. A cold flush of liquid moved up her vein—saline, antibiotics maybe. A dull burn followed, and with it, clarity.\n\n“You were all given something,” he continued, adjusting the drip. “It wasn’t meant to kill you. Only to make you quiet. Too weak to fight. Slow to think.”\n\nHis eyes met hers now.\n\n“They don’t care if you’re scared—just as long as you don’t scream when they cut.”\n\nHe said it without flinching.\n\nShe blinked at him, trying to speak—but her voice cracked under the weight of thirst.\n\nHe picked up the tin of porridge, stirred it once, then brought the spoon to her lips.\n\n“Eat,” he said.\n\nShe didn’t move.\n\n“If you don’t, your body’s going into another kind of shock. And you’ll never make it to tomorrow.”\n\nHis tone wasn’t cruel, but neither was it kind.\n\nIt was certain.\n\nSo she obeyed. The porridge tasted like salt, metal, and something faintly floral—almost perfumed. Not sweet. Not savory. Just... strange. But it sat warm in her gut, and after a few spoonfuls, her head didn’t feel like it was spinning anymore.\n\nHe watched her.\n\nNot leering. Not even with curiosity.\n\nMore like someone inspecting the stability of a system.\n\nThen he said, “My name is N, I am the captain of this ship”.\n\nMima nodded slowly. The numbness in her hands was fading.\n\nShe glanced up at him, wary. “Why are you helping me?”\n\nHe didn’t answer right away.\n\nInstead, he took the tray, set it aside, and moved toward the door.\n\nThen, just before stepping out, he said quietly:\n\n“Because I do what I want, I don’t have to give you reasons for my choices, for now I have decided that I will not let you be hurt on my watch”, his words had authority, and it felt as if the world was his and he alone decides who lives and who dies.\n\n\n\n“I will be back in an hour, I want to check you for any injuries that need to be taken care of immediately. Finish the food, it takes a crew of hundreds of men and tons of fuel to make sure that people who are allowed to live on my ship get their food. I will not keep you alive if you become difficult to keep alive”, his words had logic in them, it felt he was going out of his usual self in trying to keep her alive. It was becoming more and more clear that he had never been kind to anyone in his entire life.\n\nThe door clicked shut. She was now alone in this room, which was nowhere as comfortable as home but was not as gruesome as the operating table she was on few minutes back.\n\nAnd for the first time since the mist rolled in, Mima felt something else—Not hope. Not safety.\n\nBut a strange, unbearable relief.\n\nAs if the devil had pulled her from the fire— Only to keep her for himself. She felt chosen. \n\nThe door opened again after some time. N was back, this time in a white t-shirt , which seemed to be wet with ocean mist and stained with black grease of the ship’s engine, seemed like he had gone to fix something himself in the engine, or perhaps any other part of the ship in this last hour. N seemed efficient and intelligent, the way he talked about food, it was clear how he looked at things that were under his command in the ship.\n\n“Strip”, he commanded suddenly, Mima was taken aback. She hadn’t even recovered properly form the shock of being almost killed and here she was in front of a total stranger being told to get naked.\n\nHe stood there patiently, not moving closer to her, looking at her like an owner looks at a new pet when they first adopt them.\n\nShe tried unbuttoning herself but was too weak, she hadn’t fully recovered from the trauma to understand right from wrong. She would have questioned his motives if her body had proper nutrition, her mind had become too weak.\n\nN went right ahead and started unbuttoning her top, he striped her panties, and bra. She was leaning on him, not in an endearing way or romantic way but because she was too weak to keep herself straight, he was pulling away, tring not to touch her skin too much. Mima was confused.\n\nAfter making her naked, he stepped a two steps back, to inspect the marks on her body, he was turning and checking her limbs, her back and her neck, with almost no emotions at all, as if a butcher checks meat.\n\nHe caught her expression and spoke curtly, \'Shock masks pain. Neural damage goes undetected when the body's in prolonged trauma. Physical examination was....... necessary.\' He turned away and threw her clothes back at her. \'Get dressed.\' \n\nShe felt weird, she was expecting someone to consume her , she wasn’t approving of it, but she still wasn’t expecting to be treated like this. A pet, nothing more.\n\nHe noticed that she was having difficulty in putting back her clothes, he noticed it, he helped her to get dressed again, trying to make sure that he didn’t touch her skin any-more than what was required. He was trying to keep her dignity intact. It was finally sinking deeper in her that this man wasn’t there to harm her in any way, why was he keeping her alive, was still a mystery to her.\n\n\n\n“At least I am not dead”, she said to herself.\n\nAt this point of time she felt sturdy in her current position. Weak in body, yes—but not in spirit. Not anymore. Now she felt as if a pet rabbit of a lion , he can devourer her any moment he wanted, but he didn’t and on top of that he protected her from a certain death and was keeping her well fed. For now.\n\nAt times life throws a curve ball at us, we don’t know how to react, we face things we have never faces before, such things happen with everyone, a person is lucky if they are facing something like this on a smaller scale, Mima’s entire life was turned upside down.\n\nChapter 4\n\nDays passed—or maybe just one. Time didn’t exist here the way it used to. The room remained dim, always lit by a weak yellow lamp that never turned off. She was given more food, some kind of protein broth this time. An IV bag was replaced silently in the night. Someone had been there while she slept—but she never saw them.\n\nExcept him.\n\nCaptain N came once a day. Never spoke more than a few sentences. Sometimes asked how she felt, sometimes didn’t. He brought the food himself. Adjusted the IV. Never sent anyone else.\n\nHe was always clean. Crisp. Not like the others. His long coat buttoned to the throat, gloves always on. There was something about him that made the room shift, the air rearrange itself to accommodate his presence.\n\nShe started to look forward to the sound of the latch unlocking.\n\nAt first it was just survival.\n\nBut then...\n\nShe caught herself watching him.\n\nThe sharp line of his jaw when he turned away. The quiet confidence in the way he moved. The faint scar running beneath his right eye—like a single line of ink in a blank book. The way he never looked at her like the others did, not even for a moment.\n\nWhen he handed her the food, his fingers brushed hers. Just once. Her breath hitched.\n\nShe didn’t know what was happening. She’d been abducted, drugged, strapped down to die.\n\nAnd yet here she was, in a corner of the ship no one else dared come to, drinking hot broth from the captain’s own hands, her heart beating in her throat every time he stepped in.\n\nWhat was wrong with her?\n\nThe guilt crept in.\n\nAt night she would curl into herself, her thin blanket pulled to her chin, and remember home. The smell of fresh-cut fruit, her sister’s earrings in the sink, the rhythm of street music by the old square.\n\nBut the memories didn’t hurt like they used to.\n\nWorse, they felt distant. Faded.\n\nAnd when she closed her eyes, it wasn’t her mother’s voice she heard, or her best friend’s—it was his.\n\n“Because I do what I want. I don’t have to give you reasons for my choices. \n\n For now, I’ve decided I won’t let you be hurt on my watch.”\n\nHe hadn’t said it kindly. He’d said it with authority, like a king. Like a god.\n\nAnd it made something in her stomach twist in a way she didn’t understand.\n\nWhy had he saved her? Why her?\n\nShe had asked once, timidly, on the third day, when her body could hold itself upright again. He had tilted his head at her like one might regard a curious animal.\n\n“Why?” he repeated, lips curled slightly. “You really want to know why?”\n\nShe nodded, though her voice didn’t come out.\n\nHe leaned in—not close, just enough that his shadow passed over her.\n\n“Because I felt like it,” he said, and walked away.\n\nNo warmth. No promise.\n\nAnd yet she clung to those words like scripture.\n\nHer shame grew with every passing hour.\n\nHow could she feel this… comfort? How could she feel safe, even grateful, aboard a ship that had nearly harvested her like livestock?\n\nShe should be screaming. Plotting escape. Mourning.\n\nInstead, she waited each morning for the click of that lock, heart stammering like a child caught with a secret.\n\nShe didn’t know what this was.\n\nBut she knew one thing:\n\nShe wasn’t afraid of him anymore.\n\nAnd that terrified her more than anything.\n\nChapter 5\n\nShe didn’t ask for much.\n\nJust a few steps. A breath of real air. A glimpse of the sun—if it even existed out here.\n\nShe waited until he entered, the way he always did—measured, precise, his boots echoing softly on the steel floor. He brought a folded cloth this time. A fresh change of clothes.\n\nShe took it from his hand, steady now. Eyes level with his.\n\n“I want to walk,” she said. “Just on the dock. Just a little.”\n\nHe studied her in silence. The pause stretched. She could feel the weight of his judgment pressing into her chest, but she didn’t flinch.\n\nAt last, he gave a single nod.\n\n“Stay on the main deck. Don’t talk to the crew. And don’t try anything stupid.”\n\nThen, as he turned to go, he added without looking back—\n\n“You’ll find the sunrise better on the east rail.”\n\nShe found it hard to believe at first—how much she’d missed the color blue.\n\nThe sky was clearer than she expected, open and endless. The sea below stretched like liquid glass, with no sign of land in any direction. No birds. No horizon. Just movement.\n\nHer legs were still sore, her steps uncertain, but the wind hit her face and her lungs drank it in like medicine.\n\nThat first day, she just stood at the rail, hands gripping the cold metal, tears slipping down her cheeks before she even knew they’d formed.\n\nNo one spoke to her. No one came close.\n\nShe wasn’t one of them. Not crew. Not prisoner.\n\nShe was his.\n\nDays passed. \n\nShe didn’t ask for a clock, didn’t ask where they were going. She didn’t want to know.\n\nEach morning, she walked the main deck. At first slowly. Then with more confidence. The creak of the wood, the salty air, the rhythmic hum of the ship’s massive heart—it became her ritual. Her tether.\n\nHe gave her the access to the kitchen and she now met the old chef and his 12 year old helper, they seemed to be ordinary folks who were taken by N from a warstrucked island, if he hadn’t taken them in they would have died for sure, this made her even more intrigued about the kind of man N was.\n\nThere were parts of the ship that were off-limits—clearly marked, guarded by doors that didn’t budge. But oddly enough, his cabin wasn’t one of them.\n\nShe never dared go in when he wasn’t there, but once, she found the door slightly ajar. Inside, it was nothing like the cold clinical rooms she’d seen. It was… alive. Wood-paneled walls, old maps rolled into glass tubes, a low shelf of thick books bound in red and black leather. A bed that had never once been slept in.\n\nSometimes, she thought he left the door open on purpose.\n\nSometimes, she thought he was watching her through it.\n\nHer fascination turned to obsession.\n\nShe thought of him constantly.\n\nHow he stood, arms crossed, watching the sea. How he never raised his voice, but when he spoke, everyone moved. How the crew parted around him like a current around stone. How he never smiled.\n\nShe began inventing excuses to speak with him.\n\nShe asked what the engine room looked like. She asked if the stars were different out here. She asked what he read at night.\n\nHe rarely gave full answers. But he never pushed her away.\n\nOne evening, she knocked on the open door of his cabin.\n\nHe looked up from a chart he was studying.\n\n“I brought you tea,” she said. “I thought captains drank tea.”\n\nA ghost of a smirk passed his lips, then vanished.\n\n“I drink what I want,” he said, but he took the cup from her hand.\n\nShe hated herself sometimes.\n\nHated that the nightmares were fading. That her memories of the misty street, of the frozen people, of the surgical table—were losing their sharpness.\n\nWhat was replacing them?\n\nThe rustle of maps. The sound of boots on wood. The scent of whatever cologne he wore—bitter and expensive.\n\nShe didn’t know who she was anymore.\n\nBut she knew she was becoming someone new.\n\nAnd in the center of that change, like the eye of a storm, was him.\n\nChapter 6\n\nThe night was colder than usual.\n\nMima stood at the east rail, arms wrapped tightly around herself, watching the moonlight turn the waves into molten silver. The wind bit at her skin, but she didn’t move. Not until she heard the footsteps.\n\nShe didn’t have to turn to know it was him.\n\n“You shouldn’t be out here this late,” he said quietly.\n\n“I couldn’t sleep,” she replied.\n\nSilence fell between them, thick and weighted.\n\nShe turned, eyes meeting his—really meeting them. For the first time, he looked back and didn’t look away.\n\n“I don’t understand you,” she whispered.\n\n“You don’t need to.”\n\n“But I want to.”\n\nHe stepped closer, and for once, there was no distance, no cold professionalism, no wall.\n\n“I owe you my life,” she said. “And I hate that I feel safe around you. I hate that I don’t miss home. That I think about you all the time. That I wonder what you're thinking when you look at me.”\n\nHe was inches from her now.\n\n“You shouldn’t,” he said, voice low. “This place changes people. I am not who you think I am.”\n\n“I don’t care.”\n\nShe didn’t know who moved first.\n\nMaybe it was him. Maybe her. Maybe it was the ship itself shifting beneath their feet, forcing them together.\n\nBut suddenly his hand was on the side of her face, fingers tangled in her hair, and her lips were on his—desperate, trembling, unsure if she was allowed to want this but needing it anyway.\n\nThe kiss was not soft. It was not sweet.\n\nIt was fire meeting ice. Hunger meeting restraint. Her hands gripped his jacket like she might fall without it, and for a second, he allowed it—he allowed her.\n\nThen, just as quickly, he broke it.\n\nPulled back. Breathing hard.\n\nHis thumb still on her cheek, his voice like stone:\n\n“This changes nothing.”\n\nAnd then he turned. Walked away.\n\nLeft her standing there, heart racing, lips burning, head spinning.\n\nHe went to his cabin, Mima followed, not knowing where to this journey might be leading. \n\nAs she stood there, she couldn’t stop herself from wanting to be near him, she controlled her hands but somehow they were wrapped around his arm. He used same arm to pick her up, and bring her closer to himself, he moved her hair and kissed her neck, Mima couldn’t stop herself and her entire body shook in pleasure, it was sort of something that she was craving since so long. \n\n She held on to both his shoulders, he took off her panties and started caressing her pussy, while they both were kissing each other with deep delved passion that was being longed for by both of them.\n\n He then took his pants off, and Mima went and grabbed his dick, and started stroking it, after a few strokes she bent down and took put it in her mouth, she could feel his hard cock inside her mouth, it was exhilarating for her. She kept sucking him while N was running his fingers through her hair.\n\nHe then picked her up, took off her bra and every bit of clothing she had, he had this animalistic raw feel to him this time, Mima felt desired. He took her to himself and inserted his rock hard cock inside her , all at once, Mima gasped, she could feel him inside her, and he started fucking her, while she couldn’t stop herself from moaning. He covered her mouth with his thick hand with thick palms, she was almost screaming with pleasure but bareley any sound was coming out because of his grip.\n\nHe took out his cock from her vagina and leaned to her ear while almost garbing her pussy and whispered in her ear, “this belongs to me”. \n\n He made her lean over and started penetrating her pussy from behind, then he picked her leg up and almost fucked her in such a way that each thrust was being felt not just in her vagina but in the rest of her body too, the force was just perfect.\n\nHe then made her sit on her knees and instructed her to start stroking him, just when he was about to cum, Mima was ready to be ejaculated all over her, she was anticipating it with every stroke and suck, he stopped and told her stop, he leaned in and said,”not yet, you’ll have to wait”.\n\nSaying this, he gave her her clothes, and started dressing her, but this time, it was different, he was grabbing her, his hands were squeezing her breasts, his palms were grabbing her ass, it almost felt a complete contrast as compared to what she experienced on her very first day.\n\nAnd for the first time since she boarded this cursed ship— \n\n Mima didn’t feel like a prisoner.\n\nShe felt claimed. \n\n The morning after was silent.\n\nNo whispers. No footsteps. No sounds of the crew or the wind. Just the quiet hum of the ship and the soft ache in Mima’s limbs, like the sea itself had rocked her to sleep and forgotten to let go.\n\nShe lay in his bed, the sheets still tangled around her legs, her skin still warm where he had touched her. But the space beside her was empty. Cold. As if he’d never been there at all.\n\nNo trace of him remained in the room—not a jacket, not a scent. Only the memory.\n\nThe way he’d looked at her, like she was something he wasn’t allowed to want. The way his hands had trembled before they steadied. The way he had pulled her close in the dark, kissed her like a man who had run out of reasons not to.\n\nShe didn’t know who she was in those hours. Just that she had wanted to be seen. To be held. And he had done both.\n\nBut now, with the sunlight spilling through the narrow porthole and the sheets turning to weights across her skin, a knot had formed in her chest.\n\nWas this mercy?\n\nOr just another form of captivity?\n\nShe sat up, pulling the blanket around her like armor. Her body ached—not just from the night, but from everything before it. The hunger, the fear, the near-death numbness. And now—this.\n\nIt should’ve felt like a rescue.\n\nInstead, it felt like drowning slower.\n\nThere was a knock. Not at the cabin door. Somewhere deeper inside her, like a question she couldn’t answer.\n\nWhat did this mean?\n\nHad she crossed a line—or been pulled across it?\n\nLater that day, she saw him again. On the upper deck. Standing still, arms behind his back, watching the horizon like it owed him something.\n\nWhen he turned to her, his face was unreadable.\n\nNo smile. No anger. Just the same calm, deep silence he wore like a uniform.\n\nHe gave her a small nod. Nothing more.\n\nAnd then walked away.\n\nAs if nothing had happened.\n\nBut everything had.\n\nThat night, she lay in her own room. Alone again. The sheets too clean, the air too dry. She couldn’t sleep. Not because of what had happened—but because of what hadn’t been said.\n\nShe didn't know what she was to him now.\n\nBut she knew what he had become to her.\n\nNot savior.\n\nNot captor.\n\nSomething in between.\n\nSomething far more dangerous.\n\n"
